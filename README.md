# DataEngineering-Projects

Welcome to the DataEngineering-Projects repository. This is a curated collection of small yet powerful projects that demonstrate core concepts and practical implementations in data engineering

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to create a hands-on learning hub for anyone interested in building real-world data engineering capabilities. These nano projects focus on essential themes like batch and streaming pipelines, fault tolerance, schema evolution, data lake architecture, and integration with cloud or open-source tools.
